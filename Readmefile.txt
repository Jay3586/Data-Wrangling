Assignment:-2


textfile folders:-   Contains the 15 text files of each television brand and each brand's television and their top features. textfile example:-Sony Tv.txt which covers most of the features like brand, warranty, model, size, Resolution, Refresh rate, and Color.

Faltfile.Txt:-      This text document contains criteria of the customerâ€™s choice of brand or features which mix them in all text files.
  
hw2.py:-  
This is the Hw file that contains code to run and produce the ranking and selection of the 15 text files from textfile folders.
In this .py file first, I define the textfile path and flat-file path, and then after reading the criteria from the opening of the flat file path and using the splitlines functions. define the dictionary to store the scores for each file by the score in descending order and then after looping the textfile path folder open the file and read all the txt files. after this sort the text files by the score in descending order and print all the file names in order of priority. Finally, I would select the top three text files and print out why I selected this the justification would depend on the specific requirement of the task but might include information such as the specific criteria that each file scored well on, and how those criteria were weighted.
